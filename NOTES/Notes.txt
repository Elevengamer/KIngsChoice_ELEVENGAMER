Kings Choice 

I just looked evrything up again and again.

If i understand it right we have:
- Basic Attributes calculated by Level
- Book bonus added (basic + books.Exp)
- Aura is % to add on
- Lovers is % to add on
- nego bonus what is adding too 

- talent what is calculated by talent level, that is calculated
	by talentSheets * Upgrade Chance
- Costume bonus what adds like Talent bonus


To get a conclution:

I should add a possibility to get total amount of book experience
I should add a calculation to get max average (additional) amount 
of talents 

___________________________________________________________________

What is missing:
Aura and Lover, Nego, Costume.
As Aura and Lover Bonus is just percentage
()
----

What i also have in mind is a possibility to calculate how much 
silver it costs to upgrade the knights etc.

----

As there is the new Animal attributes that boost too

Overall it is a lot that needs to be added

I am working on Calculation by myself right now.
But if you already have some of them finished,
or you could explain them how exactly they work.

I will do everything additional
