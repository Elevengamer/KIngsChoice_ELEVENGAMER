1) Knight Power = [ ( number of strength talent stars * knight level * 20 ) + ( 100 * (book bonus ^ 0.5)) ]
NOTE: To increase your knight power you focus on leveling your knights, adding strength edicts, talent experience on strength andâ€¦. Strength Books.  But you math folks will note that strength books are a diminishing return.  So sort your knights by knight power and apply the books where you feel they are needed and spread them around.

2) Knight Talent Bonus = [ ( talent stars / 10 ) * ( 100 + 3 * ( level - 1 ) + ( level - 1 ) ^ 2 ) ] 
NOTE: Your knight talent bonus is based on the relevant talent edicts/talent experience and the level of your knight. 

3) Lover Power Points ( ballroom dancing ) -  67  * charm * ( charm + 100 ) / 1000
4) Lover Power Points ( greetings ) 3 * charm * ( charm + 100 ) / 1000
NOTE: CHARM should be on the lovers where you like their respective knights. Because, you will want to have them in the ballroom daily earning those lover power points.
